# jos_faust
C++ Modules for use with the JUCE Framework, generated from jos functions in the Faust Libraries

Add this jos_faust folder as a new module in Projucer, or
drag it into your JUCE modules directory.

#Why?

Since Faust compiles to C++, there is no real need for this module.  However, it offers the following benefits:

    * No Faust installation required.  The C++ here is tracked source ( but see ./faust-src/README.md ).
    * When working with JUCE, a ready-to-use JUCE-format C++ module is convenient to have.
    * Doxygen documentation (like JUCE's) is generated.
    * More "curation" of selected functions, while the Faust Libraries Distribution is more open, as it should be.
      (The algorithm for jos is simply to add functions as they get used in real projects.)

#Status

Just getting started. Two reverberators so far (used in JackTrip), plus the Doxygen mechanics.
