/** \mainpage JOS Modules Main Page

    These C++ modules are written in the <a
    href="./md__Users_jos_w_320C_2021_modules_JuceModuleFormat.html">JUCE
    Module Format</a> and are intended to supplement the usual JUCE
    modules.

    <a href="./group__jos__faust.html">jos_faust</a>

    \subsection BUG

    The Modules tab in the navigation bar above, and the "Modules"
    list inside the jos_faust module are EMPTY when you click on them.
    This is not understood.  Incredible time was wasted carefully
    replicating a working example (from the JUCE distribution), but it
    never worked here.  Click on Classes or Files in the navigation
    bar instead.  Bugfix welcome!

    \subsection Examples

    In the examples directory you will find JUCE apps which use one or
    more of these modules.  Create the project using Projucer from the
    JUCE distribution in the usual way.

    \subsection projucer Adding Modules in Projucer:

    In Projucer, click on Modules in the left navigation bar, and then
    on + at the lower right of that.  Select "Add a module from a
    specified folder", and navigate to wherever you have these modules
    on your computer, usually in a directory named modules.
